# E.M.M.A
#Emulated Machine Mind Assistant


(Description)
This program is currently just a virtual assistant. The goal of the project is to create an AI assistant that can turn speech commands to action. The difference between this and Siri, is that E.M.M.A has a physical GUI and is made to be responsive with the user. Currently what is monitored is exe files, weather, Wi-Fi, and basic computer diagnostics. Current commands include manipulating computer volume and exe programs, shutting down or restarting computer, minimizing, and web searching. I haven’t finished debugging the rest… The GUI contains listening status, weather, time, close button, minimize button, folder button, and save data from runtime button.


(Goals)
-There are not real goals for the project. The reason I created it was to test out things I have learned in my few years of coding. 
-Have the speech to text feature be always active instead of calling an API
-Update the GUI to have a continuous animation for Emma
-Fix buttons from stopping half of its “animation” when the click is dragged cancelled
-Moving weather icon
-Add AI mode that is made to type back instead of only processing commands (Use python chatbot)
-Better separate the modes like sleep, active, and eventually game mode
-Take out as many things possible from the UI thread to avoid using so much async for unnecessary things
-Make the program compatible with Linux and mac
-Have Emma connected to a server so it can pick up where is left off from another device (Very far goal)
-Add email reading to task while Emma is sleeping
-Remove Threading that is combined with async (This does not include async.run)


(Please do this)
Please do not steal Emma images without proper credit and using her official name. All code is free use. If you decide to help with the project please be nice about it. Remember I am not a hyper experienced programmer yet. Everything I have learned has been college or self-learned. If you wish to do the same project feel free but unless full credit is given, again do not use Emma’s art. 


Thank you for reading XD
